Yes, I agree that it is better not to make any mistakes, but what is more
important is your intention, which seems to me from what you wrote below to
be perfectly OK.

OK, that is good.  After that the most important thing is to understand
*exactly* what files Bacula will need to be able to build the Bacula  DB2
driver and what their license is.

The other critical issue is the availability of those files: that is can
anyone get them, or are they available only to certain people and under what
conditions.  At an absolute minimum, the Bacula project must be able to
possess all files needed to build Bacula.  If that is not the case, then it
would be pretty much impossible to include the DB2 driver.  The project also
needs to be able to distribute at least the binaries, which from the license
you listed seems to be OK.

The next thing that is not a requirement but is important is that any user who
wants to get those files to build the DB2 driver should have access to them.
This would permit anyone to build the driver and not just the project.  This
is not an absolute requirement, but without it, there is a serious conflict
with the spirit of the GPL.

Best regards,

Kern
