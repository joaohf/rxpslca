Hello

Attached is the dbi patch for Bacula.

To use, are necessary libdbi-0.8.3 and libdbi-drivers-0.8.3 and Bacula
trunk code with ./configure --with-dbi

Last, configuring bacula-dir.conf with:

Catalog {
 Name = MyCatalog
 dbdriver = "dbi:postgresql"; dbport = 5432; dbaddress = 127.0.0.1
 dbname = regress; user = regress; password = ""
}

dbdriver can be: dbi:mysql and dbi:postgresql. In the future can be
all drivers supported by libdbi.

The following itens need some work or review:

1- Implement bath insert with dbi
2- Review the options ./configure --with-dbi
3- To solve/review the make install when ./configure --with-dbi.
Currently,the database scripts don't  is installed on system by make
install command.
4- Review in bscan patchs
5- Documentation to install, configure and compiling bacula and libdbi

Any question I am available.

Thanks
