The files he needs are part of the DB/2 Client Development kit, which
are part of DB/2. If you legitimately have DB/2 UDB or DB/2 for z/OS,
you have them. If you don't, then you don't, and you can't get them any
other way. You'd also have to take into consideration what platforms
support DB/2 -- DB/2 isn't on all the platforms Bacula runs on, which
will cause problems.

Sounds like it might be smarter to implement a Bacula interface to the
Perl DBI:: package interface, and then the problem is permanently
solved, and not just for DB/2, but for just about any useful database
that currently exists. That would give us Oracle, Ingres, DB/2, Sybase,
etc w/o imposing other restrictions. There would be some restrictions on
what SQL statements can be fed to the DBI interface, but Bacula doesn't
do anything that fancy, so the restrictions would be fairly minor, IMHO.

See above.
