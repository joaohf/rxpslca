Hello,

I am like to report my status in libdbi interface to Bacula.

The libdbi drivers works in Bacula (configure, make, run).
Not regression tests had pass yet, because I need to do a job backup worked.

But I ran every comand in bconsole like "status dir", "list volumes"....

Basicaly I create and code in src/cats/dbi.c, change the definitions
in src/cats/cats.h and add a new option in dird_conf.h dbitype.

If someone want to see the code, please tell me. When the job backup
work. I report a new status here.

Thanks
