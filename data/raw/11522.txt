For the Director, you can set the environment variable VALGRIND=1, and the
start script (bin/bacula ...) will run the Director under VALGRIND.
Sometimes there are problems with getting the valgrind output because
VALGRIND expects the program to terminate, but Bacula is a daemon so it
doesn't normally terminate unless killed.
