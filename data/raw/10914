&gt; &gt; Redistribution Information
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; If You have developed an application that is dependent upon the files or
&gt; &gt; modules listed below or located in the directory named below, You may
&gt; &gt; distribute these files or modules, subject to the following terms:
&gt; &gt; 1) The files or modules must be in object code.
&gt; 
&gt; The above is very poor English coming from IBM.  I have no idea what it
&gt; really
&gt; means.  

IANAL, however what this usually means when talking to IBM is that you can compile and distribute modules
based on these source files, but you cannot distribute any source of the IBM-supplied bits itself. If the
modules are distributed from IBM in binary form only, you cannot include them in your package other than by
reference via dynamic linking. 

&gt; &gt; 2) You will indemnify IBM or third parties that provide IBM products
&gt; &gt; ("Third Parties") from and against any third party claim arising out of
&gt; the
&gt; &gt; use or distribution of Your application.

Usual "we didn't make it, not our fault" clause. 

&gt; &gt; 3) You may not use the same path name as the original files/modules.
&gt; 
&gt; What does the above mean -- I cannot understand why such a restriction
&gt; would
&gt; be needed.

It means you can't create something that replaces the IBM distributed files and call it DB/2 UDB Client.
Also, on AIX, you're expected to register the pathname where your stuff goes with IBM if you expect it to go
into /usr/lpp with all the other IBM-supplied stuff. They do this to minimize conflicts between file
locations, and incidentally, to force their own developers to keep the files for a single product in one
place (rather than scattering them around the filesystem like Microsoft or CA is wont to do). 

&gt; &gt; 4) You may not use IBM's or Third Parties' names or trademarks in
&gt; &gt; connection with the marketing of Your applications without IBM's or
&gt; Third
&gt; &gt; Parties' prior written consent.
&gt; 
&gt; Well, the above is a bit absurd.  It apparently says that you cannot use
&gt; the
&gt; name DB2 in "marketing" Bacula, which means that it is useless to develop
&gt; a
&gt; DB2 interface since we cannot say that we have a DB2 interface.

They have to have this in the agreement or THEY lose the ability to prosecute if someone <b>*does*</b> hijack the
trademark. They have to enforce the trademark or lose the right to it entirely. See Kleenex/Jello/Xerox
machine/etc. 

There are a set of rules for using the DB/2 trademark published on the IBM WWW site, and if you register as a one
of their developers, in exchange you get limited rights to reference the trademarks according to the
rules. They're not onerous; it comes down to you just have to spell it correctly and not cause them grief
about what you do with it. 

&gt; &gt; 5) IBM or Third Parties provide copies of these files or modules "AS
&gt; IS,"
&gt; &gt; i.e., You are responsible for all technical assistance for Your
&gt; &gt; application. 6) In Your license agreement with the recipient, You will
&gt; &gt; notify the recipient that these files or modules may not be 1) used for
&gt; any
&gt; &gt; purpose other than to enable the application, 2) copied (except for
&gt; backup
&gt; &gt; purposes), 3) further distributed, or 4) reverse assembled, reverse
&gt; &gt; compiled, or otherwise translated.

Not our fault, not our fault, not our fault, and if somebody misuses your product to do something illegal,
then it's still your fault. Welcome to American IP law. 

<b>*gag*</b> 

&gt; I think we need to understand the above a bit better before continuing.
&gt; If
&gt; you are writing something that work <b>*only*</b> on an IBM mainframe, then it is
&gt; not very interesting to the Bacula community and you might not get
&gt; approval
&gt; from us to use Bacula with the above proprietary code.  On the other hand,
&gt; if
&gt; you are writing a Generic DB2 Bacula driver that would work on any
&gt; platform
&gt; that has DB2, then it would be quite interesting.

The DB/2 client code he's working with uses an IP socket connection to talk to a DB/2 server. It doesn't care
what platform DB/2 actually runs on (albeit the client is supported on a subset of the platforms that
Bacula runs on).
