Hello,

I second Arno's comments, but add one note of caution.  If I am not mistaken,
DB2 is a commercial product, so there may be licensing restrictions (both
with the GPL used by Bacula and with IBM) on using or referencing any DB2
client libraries that are needed in Bacula to interface to DB2.  This is
something that is important to understand from the beginning.  If you are
thinking of including your code in the Bacula project, you will need to read
the Developer's Guide, which is online on the web site and then fill out and
send in the FSFE FLA (fiduciary license agreement).  Please see the
Developer's guide for more details.

Best regards,

Kern

PS: A related project is to turn the current db drivers into shared objects so
that we can support all databases with the same binary but with different
shared objects, and if one is really clever, we could support multiple
different SQL engines at the same time.
