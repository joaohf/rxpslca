&gt; Hello,
&gt;
&gt; First, sorry for the long time without reply.
&gt;
&gt; I don't forgot this ideas. But now I have time to spend it and learn more
&gt; about Bacula devel.

Nice.

&gt;
&gt; About one week back, I started some experiences about DB2 API and C/C++.
&gt; Read the src/cats/cats.h, src/cats/postgresql.c and various related files.
&gt; I understood what I need to do and how to do it.

Nice.  

&gt;
&gt; Ah, I convert the SQL script to DB2 too.
&gt;
&gt; About license GPL and DB2:
&gt;
&gt; IBM DB2 is a proprietary product and Bacula is free software how they can
&gt; stay togethers? I will use API DB2  (CLI ODBC). In DB2 license, there not
&gt; have any limit about developer and distributed the work.
&gt;
&gt; For example, if I compiling bacula with DB2, I will has DB2 client and
&gt; developers files installed. Or, if I distribute a rpm package of Bacula
&gt; (previous compiling with DB2 support) the server need have a DB2 client
&gt; installed.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; What I want say is: I can developing with DB2 API and distribute my work
&gt; with GPL license and this work use a proprietary API to connect a DB2
&gt; database server. Somebody  has experience about this situation between
&gt; interaction GPL and proprietary APIs ?
&gt;
&gt; My intend is to only develop the backend to DB2 on Bacula and source code
&gt; (GPL) necessary to it.

Yes, as you have noted, there <b>*are*</b> license problems with Bacula (GPLv2) 
interfacing to proprietary software.  There are a few solutions though, but 
I'll need to discuss this a bit with you offlist to get a good idea of what 
you are planning to do so in order to know if it is possible and to decide 
exactly how to do it.  

(By the way, I just last night, not having seen your email, discussed these 
kinds of problems with someone in the Free Software Foundation ...).

&gt;
&gt; Follow a text found in DB2 License IBM Data Server Driver for ODBC and CLI
&gt;
&gt; Redistribution Information
&gt;
&gt; If You have developed an application that is dependent upon the files or
&gt; modules listed below or located in the directory named below, You may
&gt; distribute these files or modules, subject to the following terms:
&gt; 1) The files or modules must be in object code.

The above is very poor English coming from IBM.  I have no idea what it really 
means.  It either means that you may distribute the source files providing 
they are also in the object code, or it may mean that you may distribute the 
results of using those files in object form only.  I think you will need to 
get this point clarified.   Some of the files are obviously already in binary 
form, but there are other ones which are obviously not.

&gt; 2) You will indemnify IBM or third parties that provide IBM products
&gt; ("Third Parties") from and against any third party claim arising out of the
&gt; use or distribution of Your application.
&gt; 3) You may not use the same path name as the original files/modules.

What does the above mean -- I cannot understand why such a restriction would 
be needed.

&gt; 4) You may not use IBM's or Third Parties' names or trademarks in
&gt; connection with the marketing of Your applications without IBM's or Third
&gt; Parties' prior written consent.

Well, the above is a bit absurd.  It apparently says that you cannot use the 
name DB2 in "marketing" Bacula, which means that it is useless to develop a 
DB2 interface since we cannot say that we have a DB2 interface.

&gt; 5) IBM or Third Parties provide copies of these files or modules "AS IS,"
&gt; i.e., You are responsible for all technical assistance for Your
&gt; application. 6) In Your license agreement with the recipient, You will
&gt; notify the recipient that these files or modules may not be 1) used for any
&gt; purpose other than to enable the application, 2) copied (except for backup
&gt; purposes), 3) further distributed, or 4) reverse assembled, reverse
&gt; compiled, or otherwise translated.
&gt;
&gt; Unix/Linux:
&gt; db2trc
&gt; db2ldcfg
&gt; db2lddrg
&gt; db2level
&gt; db2cli.ini
&gt; 08501252.cnv
&gt; 12520850.cnv
&gt; IBM00850.ucs
&gt; IBM01252.ucs
&gt; ReadMe.txt
&gt; libicclib.so
&gt; libcrypto.so.0.9.7
&gt; db2admh.mo
&gt; db2adm.mo
&gt; db2clia1.lst
&gt; db2clias.lst
&gt; db2clih.mo
&gt; db2cli.mo
&gt; db2clit.mo
&gt; db2clp.mo
&gt; db2diag.mo
&gt; db2sqlh.mo
&gt; db2sql.mo
&gt; libdb2.a
&gt; libdb2.sl
&gt; libdb2.so
&gt; libdb2.so.1
&gt; IBMOSauthclient.a
&gt; IBMOSauthclient.sl
&gt; IBMOSauthclient.so
&gt; IBMOSauthclient.so.1

I think we need to understand the above a bit better before continuing.  If 
you are writing something that work <b>*only*</b> on an IBM mainframe, then it is 
not very interesting to the Bacula community and you might not get approval 
from us to use Bacula with the above proprietary code.  On the other hand, if 
you are writing a Generic DB2 Bacula driver that would work on any platform 
that has DB2, then it would be quite interesting.

Best regards,

Kern

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The motivation for the choice of IBM DB2 is not very especial. I
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; need
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; learning DB2 and currently work with it.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So, before I spend more energy, what ours opinions about this?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Great idea. There is a lot of interest in DB/2 in the commercial world,
&gt; &gt; especially if you assume and test with z/OS DB/2 as the backend
&gt; &gt; database. The combination of Bacula on Linux for Z and the DB/2 on z/OS
&gt; &gt; is a very compelling argument for enterprise deployment.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; If you don't have a z/OS system handy, talk to me offlist and I can put
&gt; &gt; you in touch with some people at IBM who can make development resources
&gt; &gt; available. Failing that, UDB on Linux for Z would be a good choice, and
&gt; &gt; there is a UDB Community Edition release for that platform (as well as
&gt; &gt; Intel and POWER).
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; - read and understand the code of the different catalog backends.
&gt; &gt; &gt; - start with one of the existing catalog backends - SQLite, MySQL,
&gt; &gt; &gt; PostgreSQL - and start migrating it to DB2 SQL.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I did a little bit of looking at this a while back. Pay very close
&gt; &gt; attention to the Postgres back end; Postgres is very similar in behavior
&gt; &gt; and manner to DB/2 (both are picky about standards compliance, and have
&gt; &gt; a lot of the same quirks).
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I have a lot of DB/2 types around here; I can probably help you with
&gt; &gt; queries.
