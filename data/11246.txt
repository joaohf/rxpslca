Why not add a /etc/bacula/dbms.conf file that the admin can edit to indicate
the installed database type
and read your database type information from there? I think it's unlikely that
there will be more than one
database type in an individual Bacula install. Then you can do the db_name_init
once and not have to touch
the rest of the code.
