Even better -- someone else already did the hard part..[8-)] Gluing this into
Bacula will be fairly simple, as the database interaction is already fairly
well abstracted into a C++ class.
> 1. Test the framework libdbi. Understand how they work and limitations
The major limitation is that if you want the SQL to work on multiple databases,
then you have to use the lowest common denominator language level and features.
There are places in Bacula where various things exploit "features" of the
currently supported databases. The Postgres code is the most rabidly standards-
compliant, so I'd start with that SQL and see if it just works out of the box
(ie, if you deliver the stuff written for Postgress to DB/2, I suspect it will
be more likely to work correctly than the MySQL code, which has a few local
features).

> 2. Code in Bacula the drivers for libdbi interfacing with the databases
supported by libdbi
See above. All the nasty parts are in the C++ class that abstracts the database
access.

> 3. Create the a libdbi driver for DB2 (and others databases too)
DB/2, Sybase and Oracle already have one, and they're officially supported by
the vendor. [8-)] Once you get the DBI layer in place, you can follow the
directions provided with the database to enable the DBI driver they provide.

On the other hand, there are MySQL and Postgres DBI drivers, too. I don't know
about sqllite, but I wouldn't be heartbroken to see sqllite use fall off. It's
not like MySQL or Postgres are *that* big of a PITA to implement and manage. Or
someone could write a DBI driver for sqllite.
