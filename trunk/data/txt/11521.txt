Don't worry, libdbi has support to batch insert. Only specific
functions for postgresql like copy functions, libdbi does not have
support. And need be called in another way, but have solution.

Now I test batch insert with Mysql and libdb. Half of the regression
tests had successful.

One doubt. Have any special magic to run valgrind with Bacula?

Thanks
