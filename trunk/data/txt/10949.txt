As long as the project could get a copy of the necessary code, I don't see any
problem.  The fact that DB2 isn't on all the platforms that Bacula runs on is
not a problem -- what counts is that users have a choice and that the source
is open and that users are not restrained from building it on their systems.

I am a bit skeptical about OBDC since all the good DBAs that I know tell me
that it doesn't really work as it should.  Judging from the problems we have
interfacing to SQLite, MySQL and PostgreSQL, I can understand what they are
saying.  Also Bacula is now considerably more sophisticated in its use of SQL
now that we have Batch Insert and bat.

After thinking about it a bit, it seems to me that both Oracle and DB2 rather
freely provide developer's kits to pretty much any one who wants one -- that
would resolve the problem of availability of the interface code.  The only
other issue is the problem of incompatible licenses, which is much less of a
problem now that Bacula's code is "clean": i.e. written by me; code with BSD
3 clause license; or written by contributors that have signed the FSFE FLA.
