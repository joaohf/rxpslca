Can we get that work, once it's written? [:-)]

I'd do the following:
- make sure you understand how Bacula works, at least to the extent
that you know what the catalog is needed for.
- read some of Baculas code to make sure you understand the way it's
written; this starts with coding style, and probably does not end when
it comes to understanding how the different parts of Bacula are
organized into classes or are represented by all the *cr structures.
- use the trace feature to see what Bacula does with the catalog.
- read the developers manual; there is some documentation of the
catalog schema there.
- read and understand the code of the different catalog backends.
- start with one of the existing catalog backends - SQLite, MySQL,
PostgreSQL - and start migrating it to DB2 SQL.
- don't hesitate to ask questions, but make sure you ask clever
questions. The developers who know the existing code best are really
helpful people, but they probably prefer coding, testing, writing
documentation over explaining things... personally, even if I were
totally stuck somewhere, I'd make sure that whenever I have things to
ask I can show some progress.

Actually, I think you've got a nice project there. Not really being a
developer, I thing getting another database to work as the catalog is
rather simple, i.e. the thing itself is defined and you don't have to
spend time thinking how to layout the database etc. The catalog
database schema is really not very sophisticated, it's mainly rather
simple SQL queries and data insertions. As a result, you can do some
valuable work, but still concentrate on the main points of your
project - understanding how open source projects work and learning
about DB2.

Good luck!

Arno

Also PS:
I don't think your intentions can be misunderstood this way. In fact I
think your post was a good example of a clever question [:-)]
