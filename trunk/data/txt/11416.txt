Yes, even when it installs all the scripts, they are only configured for one
database [:-(]

I think you should add a new configure option:

  --with-dbi-driver=xxx

this will be a bit complicated, because you will need to check if xxx is one
of our supported databases, then find the path to the program so that it can
be properly put into the scripts so that the tables will be created.
You need to set two variables for substitution:

   SQL_BINDIR       points to directory where binary program resides
   DB_TYPE           the name of the binary program (e.g. pgres, mysql, ...)

Once you have defined those two substitution variables in configure.in,
everything should work correctly.

Please see <bacula-source>/autoconf/bacula-macros/db.m4 for how SQL_BINDIR is
defined.   I see that you have set DB_TYPE to dbi, but you will need to set
it to the underlying database program name (it is a poorly named variable).
It should be called DB_PROG.

I hope that helps.

Best regards,

Kern
