Perl DBI is not ODBC. It's a set of wrapper functions that allow
database-independent code to be written, with the actual database used
being selected at runtime by configuring the DBI interface code.
Database vendors supply drop-in back-ends (some open, some not), but no
code linkage occurs that is not open.
