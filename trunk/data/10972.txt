Hello

I forgot the DB2, I agree that is not a good idea implement the driver direct
on Bacula code (license problems).

But we have a way (already proposed initially by Kern and now by David). We can
use the libdbi ( http://libdbi.sourceforge.net/) to do the work and perhaps the
project "Item 34: Commercial database support Origin: Russell Howe Date: 26
July 2006" listed on http://www.bacula.org/?page=projects, will be done.

I started some experiments with libdbi, following:

1. Test the framework libdbi. Understand how they work and limitations
2. Code in Bacula the drivers for libdbi interfacing with the databases
supported by libdbi
3. Create the a libdbi driver for DB2 (and others databases too)

The motivations to use libdbi, are:

LGPL license
Database-independent abstraction layer in C
Multiple databases

If anybody has any questions, please do it.

Important: this idea not discard the already interfacing drivers already coded
in Bacula, but one way to use proprietary databases and connectivity API in
Bacula.

Thanks
