Great idea. There is a lot of interest in DB/2 in the commercial world,
especially if you assume and test with z/OS DB/2 as the backend
database. The combination of Bacula on Linux for Z and the DB/2 on z/OS
is a very compelling argument for enterprise deployment.

If you don't have a z/OS system handy, talk to me offlist and I can put
you in touch with some people at IBM who can make development resources
available. Failing that, UDB on Linux for Z would be a good choice, and
there is a UDB Community Edition release for that platform (as well as
Intel and POWER).

I did a little bit of looking at this a while back. Pay very close
attention to the Postgres back end; Postgres is very similar in behavior
and manner to DB/2 (both are picky about standards compliance, and have
a lot of the same quirks).

I have a lot of DB/2 types around here; I can probably help you with
queries.
