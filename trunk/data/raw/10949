&gt; &gt; OK, that is good.  After that the most important thing is to
&gt;
&gt; understand
&gt;
&gt; &gt; <b>*exactly*</b> what files Bacula will need to be able to build the Bacula
&gt;
&gt; DB2
&gt;
&gt; &gt; driver and what their license is.
&gt; &gt; &lt;snip&gt;
&gt; &gt; The other critical issue is the availability of those files: that is
&gt;
&gt; can
&gt;
&gt; &gt; anyone get them, or are they available only to certain people and
&gt;
&gt; under
&gt;
&gt; &gt; what
&gt; &gt; conditions.
&gt;
&gt; The files he needs are part of the DB/2 Client Development kit, which
&gt; are part of DB/2. If you legitimately have DB/2 UDB or DB/2 for z/OS,
&gt; you have them. If you don't, then you don't, and you can't get them any
&gt; other way. You'd also have to take into consideration what platforms
&gt; support DB/2 -- DB/2 isn't on all the platforms Bacula runs on, which
&gt; will cause problems.

As long as the project could get a copy of the necessary code, I don't see any 
problem.  The fact that DB2 isn't on all the platforms that Bacula runs on is 
not a problem -- what counts is that users have a choice and that the source 
is open and that users are not restrained from building it on their systems.

&gt;
&gt; Sounds like it might be smarter to implement a Bacula interface to the
&gt; Perl DBI:: package interface, and then the problem is permanently
&gt; solved, and not just for DB/2, but for just about any useful database
&gt; that currently exists. That would give us Oracle, Ingres, DB/2, Sybase,
&gt; etc w/o imposing other restrictions. There would be some restrictions on
&gt; what SQL statements can be fed to the DBI interface, but Bacula doesn't
&gt; do anything that fancy, so the restrictions would be fairly minor, IMHO.

I am a bit skeptical about OBDC since all the good DBAs that I know tell me 
that it doesn't really work as it should.  Judging from the problems we have 
interfacing to SQLite, MySQL and PostgreSQL, I can understand what they are 
saying.  Also Bacula is now considerably more sophisticated in its use of SQL 
now that we have Batch Insert and bat.

&gt;
&gt; &gt; The next thing that is not a requirement but is important is that any
&gt;
&gt; user
&gt;
&gt; &gt; who
&gt; &gt; wants to get those files to build the DB2 driver should have access to
&gt; &gt; them.
&gt;
&gt; See above.
&gt;

After thinking about it a bit, it seems to me that both Oracle and DB2 rather 
freely provide developer's kits to pretty much any one who wants one -- that 
would resolve the problem of availability of the interface code.  The only 
other issue is the problem of incompatible licenses, which is much less of a 
problem now that Bacula's code is "clean": i.e. written by me; code with BSD 
3 clause license; or written by contributors that have signed the FSFE FLA.

Best regards,

Kern
