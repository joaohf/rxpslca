I have no idea what you are talking about.  :)

Bacula now has the ability to use multiple Catalogs.  At present, all of
the Catalogs must be of the same type (e.g. PostgreSQL).  I read what Kern
said as allowing each Catalog to be a different database type (e.g. one of
PostgreSQL, another of MySQL).

A Catalog is a totally self-contained entity.  Data is not shared across
Catalogs.
