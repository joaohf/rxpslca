Hello,

I like to open a discussion about Bacula project and some questions.

For now, I am a postgraduation in development software and need to do a work to
finish my course.
The central motivation is study the contribution process on open source and
free software. How the enthusiastic user can became a developer in some
project.

To prove my ideas and way I choice Bacula project to research and write my
work.

Basically, I want to implement a catalog backend to IBM DB2. In the same time I
want to write my work based on this experiences.

The motivation for the choice of IBM DB2 is not very especial. I need learning
DB2 and currently work with it.

So, before I spend more energy, what ours opinions about this?

Thanks a lot.

PS: Please, I am not requesting you to develop this backend. It's Just a
technical opinion
