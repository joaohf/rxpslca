I have fewer problems with the idea of touching the code than with adding
another configuration file with possibly a different syntax. In fact, it
would probably take more code than what I am proposing to read the database
type from a separate file.

When the Bacula drivers become shared objects, Bacula will be capable of
working with multiple different database types simultaneously so any new
implementation should include that possibility.
