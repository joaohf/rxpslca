Ok, in line 981 to 988 I malloc buf. This function return buf. In line
461, my_dbi_fetch_row call my_dbi_getvalue (and return buf to
mdb->row[j]). So, mdb->row[j] have many buf malloced.

To free all, in line 625 I use a looping and free every mdb->row[j].

Please, see the dbi.c attached.

But I have another problem more confusing

Like I wrote, libdbi does't has support to PQ*CopyData functions. The
solution is use void* dbi_driver_specific_function(dbi_driver, const
char*) function and returns a function pointer to the specifed custom
function.

In lines
820 int (*custom_function)(void*, const char*, int);
863 custom_function =
dbi_driver_specific_function(dbi_conn_get_driver(mdb->db),
"PQputCopyData")
865 res = custom_function(myconn->connection, (const char *)mdb->cmd,
(int)len);

I declare a function pointer to custom_function, call specific
function (here, PQputCopyData) and use this.

Ok, no problems here. When I compiling this, Bacula saw:

Compiling dbi.c
dbi.c: In function 'int my_dbi_batch_insert(JCR*, B_DB*, ATTR_DBR*)':
dbi.c:863: error: invalid conversion from 'void*' to 'int (*)(void*,
const char*, int)'
make[1]: ** [dbi.o] Erro 1

I don't understend why invalid conversion. Any suggestion about?

Thanks.

PS1: In http://libdbi-drivers.cvs.sourceforge.net/libdbi-drivers/libdbi-
drivers/tests/test_dbi.c?view=markup
lines 600 and 602 it compiling and run. Have Bacula any special flag
to impossibility this construction?

PS2: dbi.c and cats.h has attached.
